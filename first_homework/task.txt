Your client the Halloween BI, Ltd. wants the answers to 2 questions: 
- What are the most important factors for predicting customer churn in this bank? 
- How much time does the bank have on average before a customer churns?

To answer those questions, you compose a to-do list:
1) explore the data to find out 
    - how many customers churn at all 
    - how much on average do churners and no-churners last as bank customers
2) predict churn (variable "Exited") with a logistic regression model, with a confusion matrix and cross-validation to assess model quality; and pick up 2-3 most important factors of churn;
3) predict churn with a decision tree and compare the accuracy of prediction between logistic regression and a decision tree and pick a more efficient model of the two; 
4) predict time to churn (variables "Tenure", "Exited").
